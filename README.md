A Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸ implementation of Craig Reynolds boids algorithm. This implementation is designed to mimick real mumurations by starlings.
Implemented using a KD-Tree for fast nearest neighbour search.

Improvements:
1. Bird FOV
2. WebGL implementation to speed up drawing of boids ( taking approximately 25%
   of execution time right now)
3. 3D version in WebGL
4. Seperate WebWorker for running the neighbour search
